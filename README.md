# players.json  

Web hosts don't like rogue PHP scripts running for too long, so I'm moving this to a github actions cron.  

Used to 1) correct names within various DB tables and 2) generate json lists (used for player drop down menus)  

`./main.php <host> <db in use> <user name> <DB password> <steam web API>`
