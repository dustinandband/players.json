# players.json  

Websites don't like rogue PHP scripts running for too long, so I thought I'd try this on github actions. Code is a bit sloppy as it was written in a hurry.  

players.json gets regenerated + committed every day to keep up with new avatar images (used for SourceTV [player search](https://imgur.com/aMC0nyE) functionality)
